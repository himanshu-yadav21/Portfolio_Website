## 📖 About This Project

This is a **basic portfolio-style webpage** built using **only HTML & CSS**.
⚡ The goal is pure **learning and practice**, not building a production-ready site.
It’s a sandbox where I experiment with layouts, gradients, buttons, and responsive design.

👉 Key features:

* 🎨 Custom fonts & gradients
* 🖼️ Developer-themed hero section with an animated GIF
* 📱 Responsive design (desktop & mobile friendly)
* 📂 Simple project showcase cards
